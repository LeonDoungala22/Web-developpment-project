## Introduction

Welcome to the Student Registration System, a web application developed as part of my Master of Science (MSc) program in Computer Engineering and Automation. This project was created as an exam project to demonstrate my skills and understanding in the field.

The system allows students to register for specific courses, with administrators having the authority to accept or reject registrations. The system caters to two main roles: the administrator, responsible for managing the application, and the student, who can register for courses.

### Features

- **Course Management:** This project encompasses all the necessary functionalities for adding, deleting, and managing course information within the system.
- **Multiple Roles:** It supports multiple roles, namely administrators and students.
- **Reliability:** The system ensures a bug-free experience for administrators and students alike.
- **Security:** Its primary objective is to create a secure and robust student registration system, guaranteeing the correct handling of student and course information.
- **Efficiency:** The system efficiently maintains records of courses and student registration details, making them accessible 24/7.

## Roles and Functionalities

### Administrator

- **Manage Course Types:** Can add, view, update, and delete course types.
- **Course Management:** Can manage new courses, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting them.
- **Registration Control:** Can review student registration requests and accept or reject student registrations.
- **Access to Data:** Can access the list of registered students.

### Student

- **View Available Courses:** Can view the list of available courses.
- **Course Registration:** Can register for specific or multiple courses.
- **Registration Status:** Can check the registration status.

## Technologies Used

This project is developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It uses JSP for generating dynamic web pages at the view layer, executes business logic on the model side, and handles request and response objects through the controller. JDBC is used for data access.

- **Backend:** Java, MySQL.
- **Front-End:** JSP, JSTL, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.
- **Server:** Tomcat 8.5.
- **Server-Side:** Servlet.

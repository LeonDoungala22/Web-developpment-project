**Exam Project for MSc in Computer Engineering and Automation**

Welcome to my Student Registration System, a web application developed as my exam project for the Master of Science in Computer Engineering and Automation program. This system allows students to register for specific courses, with administrators having the authority to accept or reject registrations. The system caters to two main roles: the administrator, responsible for managing the application, and the student, who can register for courses.

In educational institutions such as colleges or schools, students often have the opportunity to enroll in extra courses alongside their regular curriculum. This application simplifies the process by providing students with a platform to explore available courses and register for them.

## Features

- This project encompasses all the necessary functionalities for adding, deleting, and managing course information within the system.
- It supports multiple roles, namely administrators and students.
- The system ensures a bug-free experience for administrators and students alike.
- Its primary objective is to create a secure and robust student registration system, guaranteeing the correct handling of student and course information.
- The system efficiently maintains records of courses and student registration details, making them accessible 24/7.

### Administrator

- Can add, view, update, and delete course types.
- Can manage new courses, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting them.
- Can review student registration requests.
- Has the authority to accept or reject student registrations.
- Can access the list of registered students.

### Student

- Can view the list of available courses.
- Can register for specific or multiple courses.
- Can check the registration status.

## Technologies Used

This project is developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It uses JSP for generating dynamic web pages at the view layer, executes business logic on the model side, and handles request and response objects through the controller. JDBC is used for data access.

- Technology/Domain: Java Backend: MySQL.
- Front-End: JSP, JSTL, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.
- Server: Tomcat 8.5.
- Server-Side: Servlet.

# Student Registration System in JavaEE

![JavaEE](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaEE-Enterprise%20Application-brightgreen)

This is a web application developed to allow students to register for specific courses. The application's administrator can accept or reject registrations. There are two main roles in this system: the administrator, who manages the entire application, and the student, who handles course registrations.

In educational institutions like colleges or schools, there are often extra courses that students can take alongside their regular curriculum. Interested students can sign up for these courses, and this application serves as a platform for students to easily view available courses and register for them.

The Student Registration System project in JavaEE is designed to assist students in registering for various courses. It comprises multiple modules, including a module for courses, a module for course types, and, of course, student registration, all managed by the application's administrator. Students only need to complete the registration process.

## Features

- This project includes all the necessary functionalities to add, delete, and manage course information within the system.
- It supports multiple roles, namely administrators and students.
- Provides a bug-free application for administrators and students.
- The primary goal is to build a secure and robust student registration system, ensuring that student and course information is handled correctly.
- Maintains a record of courses and student registration details efficiently, making them accessible 24/7.
- This application has two main roles: Administrator and Student. Their functionalities are as follows:

### Administrator

- Can add/view/update/delete course types.
- Can add/view/update/delete new courses.

## Technologies Used

This project is developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. At the view layer, we use JSP to generate dynamic web pages, while the business logic is executed on the model side, and the controller is used to handle request and response objects. For data access, we use JDBC.

- Technology/Domain: Java Backend: MYSQL.
- Front-End: JSP, JSTL, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.
- Server: Tomcat 8.5.
- Server-Side: Servlet.

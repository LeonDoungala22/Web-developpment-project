# Web-developpment-project

Web application developed for students to enroll in specific courses. The application is managed by an administrator who can accept or reject student enrollments. There are two main roles: the administrator, responsible for overseeing the entire application, and the student, who handles course enrollments.

In educational institutions such as colleges or schools, there are often additional courses that students may want to take alongside their regular curriculum. To facilitate this, an application allows students to easily view and enroll in these courses.

The JavaEE student enrollment system project aims to help students enroll in various courses. It includes modules for courses, course types, and student enrollment, all managed by the application's administrator. Students only need to enroll in courses.

The application's features include:

1. All necessary functionality to add, delete, and manage course information in the system.
2. Support for both administrators and students.
3. Providing a bug-free application for administrators and students.
4. The main goal is to build a secure and robust student enrollment system where student and course information is managed correctly.
5. Efficiently maintaining a record of courses and student enrollment details for 24/7 accessibility.
6. The application has two main roles: Administrator and Student, each with specific functionalities:

   Administrator:
   - Can add/view/update/delete course types.
   - Can add/view/update/delete new courses.
   - Can view student enrollment requests.
   - Can accept/reject student enrollments.
   - Can view the list of registered students.

   Students:
